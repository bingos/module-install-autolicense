NAME
    Module::Install::AutoLicense - A Module::Install extension to
    automagically generate LICENSE files

SYNOPSIS
      # In Makefile.PL

      use inc::Module::Install;
      author 'Vestan Pants';
      license 'perl';
      auto_license;

    An appropriate "LICENSE" file will be generated for your distribution.

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Install::AutoLicense is a Module::Install extension that
    generates a "LICENSE" file automatically whenever the author runs
    "Makefile.PL". On the user side it does nothing.

    When "make distclean" is invoked by the author, the "LICENSE" is
    removed.

    The appropriate license to determined from the meta provided with the
    "license" command and the holder of the license from the "author"
    command.

    Software::License is used to generate the "LICENSE" file.

COMMANDS
    This plugin adds the following Module::Install command:

    "auto_license"
        Does nothing on the user-side. On the author-side it will generate a
        "LICENSE" file according to the previously supplied "license"
        command. The "holder" of the license is determined from the "author"
        meta or may be specified using the "holder" parameter.

          auto_license( holder => 'Vestan Pants and Ivor Biggun' );

        It is important to note that the "auto_license" must follow "author"
        and "license" commands in the "Makefile.PL" ( as demonstrated in the
        SYNOPSIS above ), otherwise the meta these commands provide will be
        unavailable to "auto_license". Call it a feature.
